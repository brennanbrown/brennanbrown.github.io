    <p>Hey there! :smile: My name is Brennan, I'm a 29-year-old Queer Métis JAMstack developer and content strategist from Winnipeg, Manitoba and currently reside in Calgary, Alberta. In April 2025, I graduated from Mount Royal University with a Bachelor of Arts majoring in English Honours, and have also completed both the Full-Stack Developer Program at <a href="https://www.inceptionu.com/full-stack-developer-program">InceptionU</a> in 2020 and the Growth Marketing Bootcamp at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/school/joinonramp/">OnRamp</a> in 2022, and I'm looking to help those that need web development work done, or searching for ideas and management for their next content project.
    </p>

    <p>I would also love to volunteer my time to contributing to open-source projects! I love creating and tinkering with small, static websites and projects. I'm a big proponent of putting an emphasis on accessibility and the <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/">A11y project</a> in web development.
    </p>

    <p>I'm always looking to work with people that are hopeless idealists like me, as well as who are interested in creating and working on cool, interesting, and meaningful projects! Shoot me <a href="mailto:mail@brennanbrown.ca">an e-mail</a> if that sounds like your cup of tea.
    </p>
